# Wisconsin Covid Burden Calculator
This repo will pull Wisconsin covid rates and convert them to burden which is the number of cases over a two week period.

Replace Zips = ['12345', '54321'] with the zipcodes you wish to pull.

Requires you to get an API key for Census data and HUD Zip Code data and pass to the code using your favorite secrets manager.

Detailed instructions coming soon.
